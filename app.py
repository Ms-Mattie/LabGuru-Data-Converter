    **This app converts data from the MASTER_Freezer Inventory Excel document into the correct format for the LabGuru Stock Upload template.**

    **To use the tool:**

    - Complete the fields below, which will be included in the LabGuru upload.
    - For clarity on the fields, hover your mouse over the question mark to the right of the entry field for additional information. 
    - The box name and sample position in the LabGuru template will match the corresponding entry in the MASTER_Freezer Inventory.
    - For uploading to LabGuru, copy/paste the transformed rows onto a newly downloaded Stock Upload Template. 
    - For issues or questions, please contact Mattie at mattie.goldberg@aoadx.com.
